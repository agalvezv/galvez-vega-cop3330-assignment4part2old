    //6)function that adds to array list

    //create object with presets for list management
    //place wrong information into add function
    //use an expected and actual variable to check.


    //7)function that removes from array list
    //create object with presets for list management
    //use add function to add in some things
    //use the remove function
    //use expected and actual to test what is at the end of the list

    //8)function that allows editing of title
    //create object with presets for list management
    //use function to search the list for a specific title
    //function uses a loop to check
    //function scans to take in new title
    //old title is replaced with the new title
    //expected and actual test whether all of the function went according to plan

    //9)function that adds to an existing array list
    //this is is fairly straight forward and should move very similarly to six.

    //create object with presets for list management
    //place wrong information into add function
    //use an expected and actual variable to check.

    //10) again, this is fairly straight forward
    // function that removes from existing array list
    //create object with presets for list management
    //use add function to add in some things
    //use the remove function
    //use expected and actual to test what is at the end of the list

    //11)function that allows editing of description
    //this will move in a similar manner to 8
    //create object with presets for list management
    //use function to search the list for a specific title
    //function uses a loop to check
    //function scans to take in new title
    //old title is replaced with the new title
    //expected and actual test whether all of the function went according to plan

    //12)function that allows editing of date
    //this will move in a similar manner to 9
    //create object with presets for list management
    //use function to search the list for a specific title
    //function uses a loop to check
    //function scans to take in new title
    //old title is replaced with the new title
    //expected and actual test whether all of the function went according to plan

    //13)mark something on a list as completed
    //make object for listmanagement with presets
    //make sure these presets mark each item as incomplete
    //function to mark item as complete is activated
    //expected and actual check to make sure things are working fully


    //14)display a list
    //make object for listmanagement with presets
    //create expected string
    //use display function
    //actual will be a string that takes in the results of display function
    //compare the results to make sure all is working


    //15)display an incomplete list
    //make object for listmanagement with presets
    //some parts of the list will be marked as complete
    //some will be marked as incomplete
    //create expected string
    //use display function
    //actual will be a string that takes in the results of display function
    //compare the results to make sure all is working
    //this checks specifically for the incomplete

    //16)display an incomplete list
    //make object for listmanagement with presets
    //some parts of the list will be marked as complete
    //some will be marked as incomplete
    //create expected string
    //use display function
    //actual will be a string that takes in the results of display function
    //compare the results to make sure all is working
    //this checks specifically for the complete

    //Tests of 17,18,19,20 are representative of ListMoveOperations class
